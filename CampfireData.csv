Currently, there is a challenge in properly following up on ongoing issues and tickets due to the absence of an efficient handover process.

The Campfire solution aims to streamline the handover process, ensuring that important information is shared accurately and comprehensively between shifts and staff, facilitating better tracking and resolution of ongoing issues and tickets.","The PowerApp facilitates clear and concise communication between shifts by providing a centralized platform for sharing information. This reduces the chances of miscommunication or important details getting lost, ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

OFTare was essentially upgraded to a IB sort and booking solution to automatically translate ODD customer requirements seamlessly to Freight API shipment creation for onforwarding shipments. Using Freight's own API services ensures our shipment creation process is more robust with a much higher level of support (Freight CFIT) if something were to go wrong.,"Our method for creating DHL Freight shipments to onforwarding areas relied on the classic DCG Manifesting BPI process for certain GTW movements and a legacy solution on DHL Freight (Sweden) side for injestion of the data. Unfortunately, the solution on Freight side regularly crashed (ave 1 - 2 times/month). This older solution had very few resources within Freight that could support when failures occured and often resulted in (min) 24hr delay on shipment progress.",Utilising Freight API's has proven more robust. From 1-2 system crashes/month previously to zero incidents since launch Dec 2023 till now. New process eliminates two physical scans per shipment (including containerization and movement departure steps). Ops savings ~60 secs / shipment.
